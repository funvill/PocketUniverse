==Pocket Universe - Panel design spec==

The outside of the dome is boring, I would like to add some CNC cut panels to the outside of the dome to make it look better. I am opening up the design of the panels to a few friends to they could also create them. 

There is no pay 
I can not give you panels when I am done with them. 
I don’t have anything to offer you in exchange for designing the panels. 
Sorry.

Other people have made similar projects with similar CNC cut panels for the outside of the dome. The most remarkable version is probably the “temple” at burning man

The design tends itself towards Islamic geometric patterns ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns ) and Girih ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih ) 

Don’t feel limited to what other people have done, do what you want to do. 

Due date: 
I am going to start cutting the panels now, so the sooner the better. The last day that I can delay to is end of april.
